    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are among the most popular applications of data science today. They are used to predict the \"rating\" or \"preference\" that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form. Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, for some companies like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Hotstar, the business model and its success revolves around the potency of their recommendations. Netflix even offered a million dollars in 2009 to anyone who could improve its system by 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also popular recommender systems for domains like restaurants, courses, and online dating. Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services. YouTube uses the recommendation system at a large scale to suggest you videos based on your history. For example, if you watch a lot of educational videos, it would suggest those types of videos.\n",

    "## But what are these recommender systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, recommender systems can be classified into 3 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple recommenders**: offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on course popularity and/or genre. The basic idea behind this system is that courses that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. An example could be IMDB Top 250.\n",
    "- **Content-based recommenders**: suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for courses, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person likes a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. And to recommend that, it will make use of the user's past item metadata. A good example could be YouTube, where based on your history, it suggests you new videos that you could potentially watch.\n",
    "- **Collaborative filtering engines**: these systems are widely used, and they try to predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item-based on past ratings and preferences of other users. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.±"

    "But what are the values of these vectors? The answer to that question depends on the vectorizer we are using to convert our documents into vectors. The two most popular vectorizers are CountVectorizer and TF-IDFVectorizer. We will be using TF-IDFVectorizer because some wordsoccur much more frequently in overview than others. It is therefore a good idea to assign weights to each word in a document according to the TF-IDF formula. **tfidf=term frequency/document frequency**\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is used to searching and prioritizing important words in a document. Any word gets scored by tf-idf. Higher scores indicates core terms. In its essence, the TF-IDF score is the frequency of a word occurring in a document, down-weighted by the number of documents in which it occurs. This is done to reduce the importance of words that frequently occur in plot overviews and, therefore, their significance in computing the final similarity score.\n",
